# Genomic Data Classification using Machine Learning

Project Overview
This project explores the intersection of bioinformatics and machine learning by analyzing genomic data obtained from Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). The dataset consists of 100 DNA sequences, each containing 57 nucleotides. The primary goal is to build accurate predictive models that can classify these sequences as either promoter or non-promoter regions within gene structures.

Objectives
To leverage machine learning algorithms to classify DNA sequences.
To investigate the effectiveness of various classification techniques in predicting genomic features.
To advance the understanding of genetic composition and its biological implications.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is derived from the ICU Molecular Biology Promoter Gene Sequences Data Set.
It consists of sequences labeled as either promoter or non-promoter.
Each sequence is 57 nucleotides long.
Data Source
